I’ll Show You,Justin Bieber,Purpose,"My life is a movie
And everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part
And past all the nonsense


Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting


'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure


I'll show you

Love Yourself,Justin Bieber,Purpose,"For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't


And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that


My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own


'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it

The Feeling,Justin Bieber,Purpose,"You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity


I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow


Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?


You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems

Life Is Worth Living,Justin Bieber,Purpose,"Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt


Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt


Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me


Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day

MLK Interlude,Justin Bieber,Justice,"I say to you this morning, that if you have never found something so dear and so precious to you that you will die for it, then you aren't fit to live
You may be 38 years old as I happen to be
And one day, some great opportunity stands before you
And calls upon you to stand up for some great principle
Some great issue, some great cause
And you refuse to do it because you are afraid
You refuse to do it because you want to live longer
You're afraid that you will lose your job
Or you're afraid that you will bе criticized
Or that you will lose your popularity
Or you're afraid that somеbody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house
And so you refuse to take the stand
Well, you may go on and live until you are 90
But you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90
And the sensation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit
You died when you refused to stand up for right
You died when you refused to stand up for truth
You died when you refused to stand up for justi–",i say you morning you never found something dear precious you you die you not fit live you may 38 year old i happen one day great opportunity stand you call upon you stand great principle great issue great cause you refuse do you afraid you refuse do you want live longer you afraid you lose job you afraid you bе criticize you lose popularity you afraid somеbody stab you shoot you bomb house you refuse take stand well you may go live you 90 you dead 38 you 90 sensation breath life belated announcement early death spirit you die you refused stand right you die you refused stand truth you die you refused stand justi

But it's killin' me now
